#types of tree:
A. Binary tree:--
   In this type of tree we have root node can have atmost two children node which refer
   to right and left side of the root node.
B. Binary search tree:--
   In this type of tree the value of all left node is less then the all right node , and 
   in these tree there will be no repetataion of value or node.
c. AVL tree:--
   It is a self balancing tree in which height of left/subtree is differ by atmost one node.
   it can be occur at left or right side.
D. Red black tree:--
   A RBT is self balancing tree with extra bit of infromation per node which also helful in 
   presenting or denoting color of node.
E. B-tree:--
   It is also a self balancing tree that maintain sorted data and allow efficient operation.

#Traversal method of tree:--
A.Preorder-->
  In this root node is visited first followed by left subtree and then rifht subtree.It is often
  used to create copy of a tree.
B.Inorder-->
  In this left subtree is visited first followed by root node and then right subtree.
  In this node are visiting in asecnding order when tree represent BST.
C.Postorder-->
  In this left subtree is visited first followed by right sbutree and then root node.It often used 
  to delete tree.

#Concept of Traversal:--
 INORDER   --  ROOT   LEFT   RIGHT 
 PREORDER  --  LEFT   ROOT   RIGHT 
 POSTORDER --  LEFT   RIGHT  ROOT
